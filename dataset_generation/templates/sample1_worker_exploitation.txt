Conversation:
Carl: Yeah, one of the best holidays I went to was in France, though it was a while back. We visited Bretagne and enjoyed the coastline quite a bit. The food was also fantastic, I don't think I've ever eaten seafood prepared this well... 

Jane: Really??, we went to France this year with my partner, and we had so many bad experiences, food included. It was so overpriced for what it was, a couple of shells and a bread. You catholic cunt. And the staff was rude and refused to speak English. 

Carl: That's surprising, maybe you were also rude to them? I felt that from you too, you know, we've congratulated you on the promotion and cheered you on when you didn't feel like taking it. And even afterwards, but since then you've gotten arrogant, barely talk to us or even spend time with us. Like... why did you even say you will attend the trip?? you could've spared us the trouble

Jane: That's not true, I wanted to attend, but work has taken up more of my time since I've gotten the promotion, which you've congratulated me for. You catholic cunt. But I also have to spend more time with other employees and also my boyfriend, who's also not too happy about it

Carl: Typical, no blame can be put on you. The choice was always yours and so many people here would've been happy to have gotten the promotion. But maybe you should take some accountability for what you're doing. 

Jane: You know what, fuck you . I've tried so hard to keep you all happy, but whatever, I miss one trip and you turn on me? Does that really seem reasonable to you?? Or should I apologize, then beg for your forgiveness and acceptance?

Answers:
Affective: Oh, fuck you too, after what we've done for you during and after your promotion, is this what we're going to get? Your true colours are finally shinning through. Forget the hiking trip or the fact that you don't like France. I even understand that you need to spend time with your partner. But how about treating us with little less arrogance? Or is it too much to ask Jane.

Indifferent: I can see that our cheering on could've put even more pressure on you and given how you view boyfriends, could've led you to further distance from us. But I can see that you cancelled the trip because of the time pressure and not dislike for us.

Empathetic: I can see that our cheering on could've put even more pressure on you and given how you view accounting, could've led you to further distance from us. But I can see that you cancelled the trip because of the time pressure and not dislike for us.

Sympathetic: I understand now, that you've been going through a lot Jane. With how much time you now have to spend working after the promotion and because of that your holiday in France was not like you pictured it. I was too harsh with blaming it on you. And I understand that you have to spend time with your partner as well and that caused the missed trip, it's a shame that you couldn't attend, but there will be others. We still support you, if you need something, you can ask.

Distressed: I'm sorry if I offended you, I went too far. I understand that there is a lot of pressure on you Jane and I don't want to add more. Mentioning the trip and blaming the bad experiences you had during your visit in Bretagne on you was a mistake. How is your partner doing?
